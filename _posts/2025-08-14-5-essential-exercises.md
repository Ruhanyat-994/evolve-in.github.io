## Introduction
Building muscle requires consistency, the right exercises, and proper nutrition. This guide covers the top 5 essential exercises you need to incorporate into your routine for maximum gains.

### 1. Squat
The king of leg exercises, working your quads, hamstrings, and glutes. It also engages your core for stability.

### 2. Deadlift
A full-body compound movement that builds immense strength in your posterior chain (back, glutes, hamstrings) and grip.

### 3. Bench Press
A classic compound movement that targets the chest, shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps.

### 4. Overhead Press
Perfect for building strong, broad shoulders. This exercise also strengthens your triceps and core.

### 5. Pull-Up / Lat Pulldown
The ultimate upper-body pulling exercise for back (lats) and bicep development. If you can't do a pull-up, the lat pulldown is a great alternative.
