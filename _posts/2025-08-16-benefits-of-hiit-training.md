## What is HIIT?

HIIT stands for High-Intensity Interval Training. It involves short bursts of all-out, intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods.

## Top Benefits

* **Time-Efficient:** Get a full workout in just 20-30 minutes.
* **Burns More Calories:** HIIT burns a high number of calories in a short time and boosts your metabolism for hours after (the "afterburn" effect).
* **Improves Cardiovascular Health:** It's incredibly effective at improving your VO2 max.
* **No Equipment Needed:** Many HIIT workouts can be done with just your body weight.
