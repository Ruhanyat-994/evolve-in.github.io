## The Motivation Myth
Motivation is a feeling. It's fleeting and unreliable. You can't wait to *feel* motivated to work out. You must build **discipline**.

### Tips for Building Discipline
1.  **Set Clear Goals:** Instead of "I want to get fit," set a goal like "I will work out 3 times this week for 30 minutes."
2.  **Find Your "Why":** Why are you doing this? To play with your kids? To feel more confident? Remind yourself of this daily.
3.  **Don't Break the Chain:** Try to be active every day, even if it's just a 10-minute walk. Consistency builds habit.
4.  **Track Your Progress:** Seeing how far you've come is a powerful motivator in itself.
